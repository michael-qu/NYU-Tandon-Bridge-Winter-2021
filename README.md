# NYU-Tandon-Bridge-Winter-2021

## Program Pre-requisites

Students must complete undergraduate study before taking the CS Bridge Program.

## Program Description

The bridge program is an intensive study of the required topics which are requisite information 
for general admission into the NYU-Tandon CSE graduate program. Conventionally, covering
these topics take three to four semesters to complete and must be done sequentially. Under the
bridge program, you will complete your studies in one, intensive, semester which includes all of
the material from the conventional courses in a more compact form. The bridge will require as
much as 100 hours of study, but scheduling of each module can be done at a time of your
discretion, due to the online nature of the program. Working at an average of about 30 hours of
study each week, the bridge program will be completed in one semester. You are expected, and
required to attend a weekly online meeting as well.

## Program Objectives

By the end of the CS Bridge Program students should have:
1. Basic understanding of how data is represented and how computers execute instructions
to use and modify data in order to solve problems.
2. Understanding of computational thinking: how to develop algorithms using decisions,
repetition, and decomposition into manageable components to solve problems.
3. Ability to implement and test moderate sized programs in C++, using constructs
including variables, operators, decision statements, loops, functions, and built-in data
types.
4. Ability to understand basic object-oriented programming concepts.
5. Ability to code, use, analyze the performance of, and modify fundamental data structures.
6. Have a firm understanding of operating systems topics related to processes, threads,
thread concurrency, deadlocks, and memory management.
7. Understanding of fundamental concepts in discrete math.
